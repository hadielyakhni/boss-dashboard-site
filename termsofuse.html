      <h1>Boss Dashboard > Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
      <p>
        By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
        that
        you
        read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
        our
        trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also
        shouldn’t
        try
        to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks,
        copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to .
      </p>

      <p>
        is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the
        right to
        make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you
        for the
        app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Boss Dashboard app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my
        Service.
        It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not
        jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by
        the
        official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
        programs,
        compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Boss Dashboard app won’t work properly or
        at
        all.
      </p>

      <p>
        The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="">Firebase</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Facebook</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You should be aware that there are certain things that will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of
        the
        app
        will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your
        mobile
        network provider, but cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have
        access
        to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with
        your
        mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost
        of
        data
        for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app,
        you’re
        accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your
        home
        territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the
        device
        on
        which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer
        for
        using the app.
      </p>

      <p>
        Along the same lines, cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure
        that your
        device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, cannot accept
        responsibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        With respect to ’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in
        mind
        that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to
        provide
        information to us so that we can make it available to you. accepts no liability for any loss, direct or
        indirect,
        you
        experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
      </p>

      <p>
        At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS – the requirements
        for
        both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and
        you’ll
        need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. does not promise that it will always update the
        app so
        that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device.
        However,
        you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing
        the app,
        and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you
        otherwise,
        upon
        any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the
        app,
        and (if needed) delete it from your device.
      </p>
